<html>Inserting a key into a B-tree  Inserting a key into a B—tree is signiﬁcantly more complicated than inserting a key into a binary search tree. As with binary search trees, we search for the leaf position at which to insert the new key. With a B-tree. however. we cannot simply create a new leaf node and insert it. as the resulting tree would fail to be a valid B-tree. Instead, we insert the new key into an existing leaf node. Since we cannot insert a key into a leaf node that is full. we introduce an operation that splits a full node y (having 21‘ — 1 keys) around its median key yakey, into two nodes having only I —1 keys each. The median key moves up into y’s parent to identify the dividing point between the two new trees. But if _\"5 parent is also full, we must split it before we can insert the new key. and thus we could end up splitting full nodes all the way up the tree.  As with a binary search tree, we can insert a key into a B-tree in a single pass down the tree from the root to a leaf. To do so, we do not wait to ﬁnd out Whether we will actually need to split a full node in order to do the insertion. Instead, as we travel down the tree searching for the position where the new key belongs, we split each full node we come to along the way (including the leaf itself). Thus whenever we want to split a full node y, we are assured that its parent is not full.  </html>
