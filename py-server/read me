Okay soo the Django tutorial link is: 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/
But don't attempt to read it now, I will explain in breif

The link in which Image is send from andriod app to Django server is: 
1. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8447299/upload-a-file-with-android-to-django-web-service
2. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2935946/sending-images-using-http-post
3. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9758982/android-django-image-upload

I used the first link and removed the error causing codes for now, once basic system is made, We will try to add more code related to contrainsts and security (which I have removed for now) to make the system robust.


Following are the steps which I have followed for the installation.


Steps for Django....

1.Python :
	Already installed in ubuntu
2.Python setup tools :
	apt-get install python-setuptools
3.SQLite (Optional , if database needed): 
	sudo apt-get install sqlite



4. Checks versions of all:
	Python: python --version
	SQLite: sqlite -version
	Django: python -c "import django; print(django.get_version())"



Do the above steps, rest follow the next steps after you get basic idea of Django (After briefing of Django)...
The below steps are used for project creation which I have aleady send you....
To run the below project, Just go to directory with manage.py file and follow step 6.
There is also a html page, use it to try uploading an Image. Leave step 5,7,8 for now.


5. Create project  :
	Go to location where you wanna store the project and run:
	django-admin startproject ImageAnalyser

6. Test the project by running the manage.py file as:
	python manage.py runserver

7. After the above test, stop the server and create an app in your project:
	python manage.py startapp ImageProcess


8. Sync Database after creating the model of the app (Model and Database in this app is not needed):
	python manage.py syncdb
